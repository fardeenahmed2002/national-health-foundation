                    Recognizing a stroke early is crucial. Use the FAST method:
                    - **F**ace drooping
                    - **A**rm weakness
                    - **S**peech difficulty
                    - **T**ime to call emergency services

                    Additional symptoms include sudden numbness, confusion, trouble seeing, walking difficulty, and severe headache with no known cause.

                    **What to Do:**
                    - Call emergency services immediately.
                    - Keep the person calm and comfortable.
                    - Do not give them food, drink, or medication.
                    - Note the time symptoms began.

                    Early treatment increases the chances of recovery and reduces the risk of permanent damage.

        content: `
                    **Signs of a Heart Attack:**
                    - Chest pain or pressure (may feel like squeezing or fullness)
                    - Pain in arms, jaw, back, or stomach
                    - Shortness of breath
                    - Cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness

                    **What to Do at Home:**
                    1. **Call emergency services immediately.** Do not delay or wait for the pain to go away.
                    2. **Chew aspirin (if available and not allergic).** It helps prevent blood clotting.
                    3. **Keep the person calm and seated.** Avoid lying them flat unless they faint.
                    4. **Unlock the door.** So emergency services can enter if the person collapses.
                    5. **Monitor breathing and consciousness.** Be ready to perform CPR if necessary.

                    Heart attacks require professional medical treatment. Home action can only stabilize temporarily.

                    **Note:** Women and elderly may show less typical symptoms—fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath.

        content: `
                    **Types of Burns:**
                    - **First-degree:** Red, non-blistered skin (e.g., mild sunburn)
                    - **Second-degree:** Blisters, swelling, and more intense pain
                    - **Third-degree:** White or charred skin, may be numb due to nerve damage

                    **First Response Steps:**
                    1. **Cool the burn immediately.** Hold under cool (not ice-cold) running water for 10–20 minutes.
                    2. **Remove tight items.** Carefully remove jewelry or clothing near the area—unless stuck to the burn.
                    3. **Protect the area.** Cover with a clean, non-stick bandage or cloth to prevent infection.
                    4. **Avoid home remedies.** Do not apply ice, butter, or toothpaste—they can worsen damage.
                    5. **Do not pop blisters.** It increases infection risk.
                    6. **Seek medical help** for large, deep, or facial burns, or if caused by chemicals or electricity.

                    **Tip:** Always keep a basic burn cream and sterile gauze in your first aid kit for quick access.

        category: "Emergency Care",
        content: `
                    **What is CPR?**
                    CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is a lifesaving technique used when someone's heartbeat or breathing has stopped.

                    **When to Use CPR:**
                    - The person is unconscious
                    - They are not breathing or only gasping
                    - There is no pulse

                    **CPR Steps (for adults):**
                    1. **Check for responsiveness.** Shake gently and shout.
                    2. **Call emergency services** or have someone else call.
                    3. **Begin chest compressions:**
                    - Place your hands in the center of the chest.
                    - Push hard and fast—at least 100–120 compressions per minute (to the beat of “Stayin’ Alive”).
                    - Depth: At least 2 inches (5 cm), allowing full recoil between compressions.
                    4. **Give rescue breaths (if trained):**
                    - After every 30 compressions, give 2 breaths.
                    - Tilt the head back, lift the chin, and pinch the nose.
                    - Blow until you see the chest rise.

                    **Important:**
                    - If you're untrained or unsure, perform Hands-Only CPR (just chest compressions).
                    - Use an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) if available.

                    Regular CPR training can help you respond confidently in a real emergency.

                    **Recognizing Choking:**
                    - Inability to speak, breathe, or cough
                    - Clutching the throat (universal sign of choking)
                    - Skin turning blue or pale
                    - Panic or loss of consciousness if untreated

                    **For Adults and Children Over 1 Year Old:**
                    1. **Ask if they’re choking.** If they nod and can’t talk—act fast.
                    2. **Perform the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts):**
                    - Stand behind the person.
                    - Wrap your arms around their waist.
                    - Make a fist with one hand and place it just above their navel.
                    - Grasp the fist with your other hand and thrust inward and upward.
                    - Repeat until the object is expelled or they become unresponsive.

                    **For Infants (Under 1 Year Old):**
                    1. **Back Blows & Chest Thrusts:**
                    - Lay the baby face-down along your forearm.
                    - Give 5 firm back blows between the shoulder blades.
                    - Flip the baby and give 5 chest thrusts using 2 fingers on the center of the chest.

                    **If the Person Becomes Unresponsive:**
                    - Call emergency services immediately.
                    - Begin CPR and check the mouth between breaths to see if the object is visible and removable.

                    **Never delay**—choking can turn fatal in minutes. Quick action makes all the difference.
